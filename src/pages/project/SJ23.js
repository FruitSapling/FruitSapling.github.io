          I hosted Service Jam 2023 alongside another co-host in Newcastle. Service Jam 2023 was an intensive two-day event where multidisciplinary teams came together to rapidly prototype and test new service concepts. This event fostered creativity, collaboration, and user-centered design thinking. The outcome was a set of innovative service prototypes addressing real-world challenges. I put together this video to summarise the event.
